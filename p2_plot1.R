#1.Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 
#1999 to 2008? Using the base plotting system, 
#make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources 
#for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

#Create a data frame for the total of emissions for different year and type

sum_nei <- data.frame(sum_nei)
#need to convert rownames (year) into another column "year"
